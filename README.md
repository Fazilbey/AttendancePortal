# 🎓Attendance Portal

Welcome to the Attendance Portal, an innovative solution designed to streamline attendance management in universities.

This platform empowers students by allowing them to take charge of their own attendance through a QR-based system.
By scanning a QR code, students can easily mark their attendance, reducing administrative overhead
and enhancing the accuracy of attendance records.📚👩‍🎓👨‍🎓

The Attendance Portal is built using React, a popular JavaScript library known for its efficiency and flexibility.
This ensures a robust, responsive, and user-friendly interface that can handle the demands of a university environment.💻🚀
